I will be building a webiste / app for a dog rescue site since a large part of my background is more around pet hospitals and adopting pets

feature list
the project will be featuring a 
- login and registration page
- rescue page:
    the client will be able to select and view the pets profile seeing their name,
     breed, location, age, fixed or not flixed and even their description(optional) if
     that owner wants to provide information of them.
- with 3 links at the top of the page
    * add rescue (client can add a new pet for adoption)
    * logout (takes client back to login/registration page)
    * my rescue (client can see a list of their rescues)


- this website is to bring more pets that are in need of rescue of put for adoption
 *bonus if I add some type of like button (or something like that) for people pending
  to rescue that pet 
 * a google map feature to locate the place where the pet is when location is in the
    database of that specific pet

- language stack will be in python
